description: Opens the Unpaidinterns dashboard, a local 3D view of every Claude Code and Codex session on this machine. Use when the user wants to see, open, start, stop or update Unpaidinterns, the intern dashboard, or a view of what their agents are doing.

Run the Unpaidinterns launcher with the action the user asked for, and report what it printed.

Pick the action from the user's request, or from `$ARGUMENTS` when the skill is run as a command:

| User wants | Action |
|---|---|
| To open or see the dashboard (the default) | `start` |
| To try it without real sessions | `demo` |
| A fresh sign-in link, or the page asks to sign in | `restart` |
| To shut it down | `stop` |
| To check whether it is running | `status` |
| The latest version | `update` |

Run exactly this, with the action in place of `ACTION`:

```bash
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/unpaidinterns.sh" ACTION
```

The first start fetches and builds the app, which takes about a minute; tell the user that while it runs. The script opens the browser itself, so don't open URLs yourself.

If the script prints an `Error:` line, pass the message on as it is: it already says what to install or do next. Don't try to install Node, pnpm or git yourself.
